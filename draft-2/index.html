            <h1><strong>Text is a channel for rhetoric, let’s add one for logic</strong></h1>
            <h2><strong>Text should not be left alone</strong></h2>
            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="1">Many <em>things-worth-knowing</em> are put into text instead of conversations and experience.</div> <div class="n" node-id="2">This is unfortunate, because getting them back out of text is hard</div>.</div>
            <div class="n" node-id="3"><div class="p">Here are the core problems with pure text, as a medium for communication:</div></div>
            <ul>

            <li><strong>[rhetoric-logic confusion]</strong> <div class="n" node-id="5">Evolution put rhetoric and logic in the same room of the mind</div>. <div class="n" node-id="157">This has the side-effect of making us extremely vulnerable to believing the wrong things</div>. <div class="n" node-id="158">Bad logic becomes persuasive through good rhetoric</div>. <div class="n" node-id="159">Good logic stays undiscovered through bad rhetoric</div>. <div class="n" node-id="160">The linearity of text makes this worse</div>, <div class="n" node-id="161">by forefronting rhetoric (which is increased in magnitude with the building of every subsequent sentence)</div> at the expense of <div class="n" node-id="162">backgrounding logic (whose structure is hidden).</div></li>

            <li><strong>[apprehending structure]</strong> <div class="n" node-id="148">The structure of an argument is important for analyzing it.</div> <div class="n" node-id="4">It is difficult to immediately see that structure</div>, though, <div class="n" node-id="149">because text is linear - one statement follows another</div>. <div class="n" node-id="150">Imagine two adjacent sentences that are actually structurally parallel, and together stand as premises which hold up the conclusion of a third sentence. Let us concretize this with a familiar example: <em>“Socrates is a man. All men are mortal. Socrates is mortal.”</em></div> <div class="n" node-id="151">Nothing about the form of text gives the first and second sentences the clothes of premises</div>, <div class="n" node-id="152">nor the third sentence the mark of conclusion</div>. <div class="n" node-id="153">Nothing about the form of text even makes the link from the first sentence to the third</div>, <div class="n" node-id="154">nor the second to the third.</div> <div class="n" node-id="155">At most, one could argue that a 2 —&gt; 3 link is implied by adjacency</div>. <div class="n" node-id="156">This is true, but a 1 —&gt; 2 link is also implied and is <em>wrong</em>. So link-implication-by-adjacency is not reliable.</div> We need better, especially for more complex argumentation.</li>


            <li><strong>[exploration]</strong> <div class="n" node-id="6">The author's imposed order on text is hard to break</div>. <div class="n" node-id="164">When I read an interesting point, I might want to see how it relates to another particular point</div>. <div class="n" node-id="165">Perhaps I read about how London taxi drivers developed larger hippocampi to accommodate the spatial knowledge of car-traversable London, and want to know whether this big brain gain came at the expense of some other cognitive abilities</div>. <div class="n" node-id="166">I will be at the text's mercy</div>. <div class="n" node-id="167">My desire is only reliably fulfilled if that relation just so happens to be the next sentence</div>. <div class="n" node-id="168">Else I need to keep reading, and hope that I will not forget my query (and hope that the query will be eventually answered).</div></li>

            <li><strong>[high-level understanding]</strong> <div class="n" node-id="7">It’s difficult to get a sense of the key points of a text</div>. <div class="n" node-id="169">When reading scientific papers, common advice is to jump to the abstract, then conclusion, and then check any interesting figures before reading the paper in its entirety</div>. <div class="n" node-id="170">In speed reading-esque circles, common advice is to read the first and then last sentences of each paragraph on a first pass</div>. <div class="n" node-id="171">These are both abuses on the form of text, which is inherently linear (read it start-to-finish) thus non-interactive (no jumping around!)</div>. <div class="n" node-id="172">Yet by treating the text as such, you take up the reins of control over your interaction</div>. You decide where to go, and thus your understanding is now your active responsibility instead of being delegated solely to the author. <div class="n" node-id="173">But with the current incarnation, text does not like this use, and so the form of text itself struggles against you.</div></li>

            <li><strong>[search]</strong> <div class="n" node-id="8">It’s hard to find the exact information wanted from text</div>. <div class="n" node-id="174">For example, you may know that David Hume, in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, outlines base rules that our minds use to combine pre-known concepts into new ones. Based on this, imagine that you want to know exactly what these base rules are.</div> The text will give you a hard time in your search. <div class="n" node-id="175">You can’t use a quick visual inspection - the table of contents isn’t helpful here, and there are too many pages to flip through</div>. <div class="n" node-id="177">You can’t even do a <em>Find</em> on your PDF viewer - the particular terms he uses to express this idea are not the same as the ones I have used</div></li>

            </ul>
            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="9">Side note about <strong>[search]</strong>: Of all the flaws of text mentioned, this is the closest to being solved.</div> <div class="n" node-id="178">We now have vector databases that allow text to be <em>semantically</em> searched (search-by-meaning) instead of <em>syntactically</em> searched (search-by-exact-text). The underlying mechanism is to convert your search query to an eerie mathematically-represented understanding of the <em>meaning</em> of the query, and compare its numeric distance to similarly-represented chunks that encompass the entire underlying text.</div> <div class="n" node-id="179">It’s not mainstream yet, but I suspect that books will start including search tools to increase their interactivity soon</div>. <div class="n" node-id="180">There’s probably profitable startup idea there - an LLM that unlocks knowledge bases when the book purchase is verified</div>. <div class="n" node-id="181">Personally, I find this monetization to be disgusting as it is a movement towards barriers to knowledge.</div></div>

            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="10">This post details an experimental attempt to fix many of the problems of text, while also demonstrating the experiment. The tech is there. It’s been there for a while. But the idea and its adoption do not yet exist.</div></div>

            <div class="n" node-id="11"><h2><strong>On the utility of rhetoric</strong></h2></div>
            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="12">At its core, all of language is just gesticulating vaguely at concepts and things which are too big for us to hold losslessly in our tiny brains.</div> <div class="n" node-id="13">The trick to good communication is thus to make pretty signposts and point them in the roughly-correct direction for the particular traveller you’re trying to orient.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="14"><div class="p">Seen from this lens, rhetoric is a wonderful pathogen with which to infect readers with understanding.</div></div>
            <ul>
            <li><div class="n" node-id="16"><strong>[memory]</strong> A well-turned phrase makes things memorable. Personally, it’s like the fog I’ve been wading through suddenly settles into solid ground. There is joy and relief, and a deep (though often erroneous or illusory) feeling of <em>knowing</em>.</div></li>
            <li><div class="n" node-id="17"></div><strong>[non-conscious]</strong> Rhetoric speaks to the secret parts of the self in the hidden society of the mind. Perhaps more important than speaking to conscious-me, rhetoric moves the core actuators of my being. There is a difference between knowing something in the brain, knowing something in the heart, and knowing something in the bones. Rhetoric is the unifying politician that stirs them all. This is good, but unfortunately it also blurs their boundaries. A thing which should only be heart-known could seep into the brain and bones.</li></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="18">Understanding, however, is not the same as truth-seeking. You can certainly understand things that are false, and there is often value in doing so. The problem comes from believing that false things are true.</div></div>
            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="19">Like a bad roommate, rhetoric gets logic drunk in the text and then leaves it alone to find its own way home.</div> <div class="n" node-id="20">Thus our solution should preserve the <em>life-of-the-party</em>ness of rhetoric, while also keeping logic sober.</div></div>

            <h2><div class="n" node-id="21"><strong>The solution: A logic-forward channel to complement text’s rhetoric-forward channel</strong></div></h2>
            <div class="p">The solution is simple: <div class="n" node-id="22">let rhetoric have its stage in text</div>. <div class="n" node-id="23">Meanwhile, we assemble a parallel arena for logic to perform, and place it visibly at text’s side</div>. <div class="n" node-id="24">These are different views on the same content, but they are synced.</div> <div class="n" node-id="25">The reader may flit between them as they see fit.</div> <div class="n" node-id="26">The writer may use the logic-forward channel to extend communication beyond text</div>, <div class="n" node-id="27">by making the implicit into the explicit</div>, and <div class="n" node-id="28">drawing links that are not easily seen through linear presentation.</div></div>

            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="29">Rhetoric is simple and requires little to perform. Logic, despite being the quiet one, is more of a diva. Let us investigate her needs.</div></div>

            <h3><strong><div class="n" node-id="30"></div>The building blocks of logic’s stage</strong></strong></h3>
            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="31">To show logic is to show structure. Thus we require knowledge of what is allowable in the structure, and a way of marking up statements to fit into that structure.</div></div>
            <div class="p">The particulars of what is allowable in the structure is a work-in-progress. I welcome any ideas for improvement. For the work you are currently reading, the basics of the structure are as follows:</div>
            <ul>
            <li><div class="n" node-id="32">Nodes, which are boxes that each represent a particular point which the content makes.</div></li>
            <li><div class="n" node-id="33">Directed links, which are arrows that relate nodes to each other. These are the workhorse of the structure.</div></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="p"><div class="n" node-id="34">Links have different types. The types currently used are as follows:</div></div>
            <ul>
            <div class="n" node-id="35"><li>claim</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="36"><li>analysis</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="37"><li>artefact</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="38"><li>constraint</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="183"><li>part</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="184"><li>example</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="185"><li>extension</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="186"><li>context</li></div>
            </ul>
            <div class="n" node-id="39"><div class="p">Thus if <em>Node A</em> points to <em>Node B</em> with the link type of <em>claim</em>, then we know that A is a premise which supports the conclusion B.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="40"><h3><strong>Marking the Main Conclusion</strong></h3>
            <div class="p">I have marked the main conclusion of this essay. This serves as a focal point for all other nodes.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="41"><div class="p">The advantage is that it is easy to show, from any point of the text, how this links to the overarching point-of-interest (the main conclusion).</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="42"><div class="p">The disadvantage is that, in fact, there may be multiple overarching points-of-interest.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="43"><div class="p">A future extension should thus generalize the concept of the “main conclusion” to multiple overarching points-of-interest (main conclusion<em>s</em>).</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="44"><h3><strong>Levels of detail through node groups</strong></h3></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="45"><div class="p">For years, video games have been cheating computational demands by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">lower-resolution (computationally cheaper) elements for things that are far away</a>.</div> <div class="n" node-id="52">The player won’t notice or care yet, anyway - these far things are not in their immediate vicinity.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="46"><div class="p">Similarly, this text uses node groups in its High Level view in order to show how the point leads to the main conclusion.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="47"><div class="p">There are interesting extensions here:</div></div>
            <ul>
            <div class="n" node-id="48"><li><strong>[recursive node groups]</strong> Should we allow node groups to themselves form higher-order node groups? This would allow for multiple levels of detail, but would cost complexity on all fronts (UI, code, the author's markup time).</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="49"><li><strong>[multiclassing]</strong> Should a node be allowed to have &gt;1 node group? How would this affect the representation to the user?</li></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="50"><li><strong>[redundancy]</strong> Should multiple parts of the text be allowed to be associated with the same node?</li></div>
            </ul>
            <div class="n" node-id="51"><div class="p">Note: in practice, levels of detail techniques in video games often break down in jarring ways, e.g. distracting the player by having more details suddenly pop in.</div> <div class="n" node-id="53">But these are, I believe, implementation issues or hardware limitations, rather than problems with the metaphor.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="54"><h2><strong>Some insights from marking up the logic in this post</strong></h2></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="55"><h3><strong>The process was painful, but this is likely fixable</strong></h3></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="56"><div class="p">Here were the steps:</div>
            <ol>
            <li>Write the post on Notion</li>
            <li>Export to markdown, generate HTML from the markdown</li>
            <li>Specify the graph details in the JavaScript, and couple the HTML to particular nodes.</li>
            <li>Discover weak aspects of the post and structure</li>
            <li>Edit and repeat from step 3</li>
            </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="n" node-id="57"><div class="p">The visualization code was a one-time cost that is usable for any future posts, so I won’t discuss it.</div> Feel free to check out the code on GitHub, but be warned that it’s hacky.</div>
            <div class="n" node-id="58"><div class="p">The pain comes from the process of marking up the text to extract the logic graph.</div> <div class="n" node-id="59">This is fixable - I could create a custom GUI for making the graph.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="61"><h3><strong>The process helped me see my own thinking more clearly</strong></h3></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="62"><div class="p">Writing, of course, always clarifies thought.</div> <div class="n" node-id="63">But that clarification often comes with an illusory sense of certainty, that when tested, falls apart.</div> <div class="n" node-id="64">Writing too often helps me <em>believe</em> what I think, without ensuring that I <em>know</em> it.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="65"><div class="p">In this way, the logical layer was a stress-test for those beliefs. This is the second post I have written in this format. Like the first, I immediately saw weaknesses in my own argumentation and thought.</div></div>
            <div class="n" node-id="66"><div class="p">Thus the act of logically marking-up my beliefs was a nice complement to writing them down.</div></div>

            <section>
                <div class="n" node-id="67"><h3><strong>The logical markup is still subjective</strong></h3></div>
                <div class="n" node-id="68"><div class="p">Prior to starting, I believed that the outcome would be formal and unambiguous. This is not the case. Even with the framework fixed, my subjectivity rests within the following choices:</div></div>
                <ul>
                    <li><div class="n" node-id="69"><strong>[node text choice]</strong> At first, I believed that nodes should be fully self-contained and unambiguous. However, this made nodes too long, which limited their interface utility. Node 41, for example, was originally "Showing the path from the current point in content to the main conclusion makes text more understandable", which was too much. It is now ""Showing path to main conclusion increases understandability". Additionally, the drive to disambiguate led to too much local redundancy. For instance, Node 52 initially began <em>"Levels of details work..."</em> and now begins <em>"This works..."</em>. When the reader is in its local neighborhood, the meaning of "This" is clear.

For instance, is Node 61 (<em>"Logically marking up this text helped clarify my thoughts"</em>) a claim for Node 54 (<em>"Some insights from marking up the logic in this post"</em>), an artefact or an analysis? All of these choices are fine, and so my decision to actualize one over the other adds a flavor to the logical structure.</div></li>

They are implied, and this surprised me as I thought I was being clear. As an example, the main point of <strong>[rhetoric-logic confusion]</strong> was that <em>"Text obfuscates logic through rhetoric"</em> (Node 912). This is fairly clear from reading the text, yet it is never stated explicitly.</div>
